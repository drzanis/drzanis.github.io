## Professional Experience

### Research & Technology Specialist | Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST)  
**August 2024 - Present**  
As a Research & Technology Specialist, I am engaged in cutting-edge research in the areas of **log-based anomaly detection**, **anomaly detection** and **vulnerability detection & patching** using **Deep Learning** and **Large Language Models**. My primary focus is on the development of intelligent systems that can automatically detect and patch software vulnerabilities. I work alongside an interdisciplinary team to improve software security and validation techniques, ensuring their practical application in real-world systems.

### Post-doctoral Researcher | University of Luxembourg ###
**February 2024 - July 2024**

### Research and Development Specialist ###
**November 2023 - January 2024**

### Doctoral Researcher | Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg  
**November 2019 - October 2023**  
During my PhD, I focused on **log parsing** and developing **Deep Learning-based anomaly detection systems** to enhance security testing. I contributed to several key research projects aimed at improving software validation methods. My research also explored the intersection of **Machine Learning** and **Software Security**, where I developed techniques to detect anomalies autonomously. I was also involved in publishing multiple research papers in international journals and conferences.

### Software Developer | [Softflix Software Solutions]  
**September 2017 - October 2019**  
As a Flutter/Dart Developer, I worked on developing high-performance, cross-platform mobile applications. My role involved writing clean and efficient code using Flutter and Dart, ensuring the apps provided a seamless experience on both iOS and Android. I contributed to the full mobile app development lifecycle, including UI/UX design, API integration, and performance optimization.

I also collaborated closely with the development and testing teams to conduct unit testing, debugging, and bug fixing to ensure the applications were secure, stable, and user-friendly. My work involved integrating security measures to protect sensitive user data, along with ensuring compliance with industry standards and guidelines. This experience also gave me exposure to version control systems like Git, mobile app deployment processes, and CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and delivery.
